Purpose
-------

Bored? Want to play an online game? Or go out? Maybe your friends are thinking the same thing! Check out who's available for what on Availabol. Inspired by Availabol's more mature cousin [Happoning](http://happoning.com) for planning events with specific times.

Demo
----

Availabol is available to help you plan at http://availabol.herokuapp.com/

Installation
------------

Install node.js and npm: http://nodejs.org/ then get socket.io:

    npm install socket.io

To start the server

    node app.js

Visit the page at http://localhost:3000.

Plans
-----

* Different rooms by activity and/or social group
* Some kind of protection for your name
* Happoning-style "critical mass" feature that will alert you when there's many others with the same availability
* Better look
* Easier way to communicate with the server (XMPP, mobile app, etc.)
